## Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch  


## Instructions  
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, a Shiny application and second, a Rstudio presentation about the application.  

## Shiny Application 

The main idea of this application was to use textbox, radio button, checkbox, ... for learning.

1. Shiny application shows in the first tab, Charts, an oportunitie to compare plotly with normal plot charts. 
	- It´s possible to choose, by selectimput a data set: mtcars, iris, airmiles.
	- A checkbox to alternate between Plot and Plotly type of charts. 
	- Plotly provide to you more options of visualization.

2. At the second tab, Data Set details, it´s possible to take a look into the data set for each data set. 
	- Have a radio buttom where you can shwith between all tabel or just the headers.
	- OBS. For airmiles data set, was necessary to make a transformation from Time Series data to data frame to show it as a table.

## Reproducible Presentation

This presentation, shows more details about the shiny application and about the data sets used.
As it was built by Rstudio, it was published directly to Rpubs.
